This sector generates crop production, environmental impacts of agriculture, and the cost of food.\nWell-being trust and tension. This sector generates the societal ability to react to a challenge (like climate change) as a function of social trust and social tension, and it generates global indicators measuring both environmental and societal sustainability (including the Average Well-being Index).
