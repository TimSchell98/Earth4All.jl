The delay for the passing functions is equal to 20 (since there is a gap of 20 years between one group and the next one), while the delay for the deaths function is the average life expectancy at age 60 (which varies over time).

This sector generates total population from fertility and mortality processes, potential workforce size, and the number of pensioners.\nOutput. This sector generates GDP, consumption, investment, government spending, and jobs. The economy is seen as a sum of a private sector and a public sector.\nPublic sector. This sector generates public spending from tax revenue, the net effect of debt transactions, and the distribution of the budget on governmental goods and services (including on technological advance and the five turnarounds).\nLabor and market. This sector generates the unemployment rate worker share of output, and the workforce participation rate, based on the capital output ratio.\nDemand. This sector generates income distribution between owners, workers, and the public sector.\nInventory. This sector generates capacity utilization and the inflation rate.\nFinance. This sector generates the interest rates.\nEnergy. This sector generates fossil fuel-based and renewable energy production, greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use, and the cost of energy.\nFood and land use. This sector generates crop production, environmental impacts of agriculture, and the cost of food.\nWell-being trust and tension. This sector generates the societal ability to react to a challenge (like climate change) as a function of social trust and social tension, and it generates global indicators measuring both environmental and societal sustainability (including the Average Well-being Index).
