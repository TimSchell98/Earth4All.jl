This is the documentation page for [Earth4All.jl](https://github.com/worlddynamics/Earth4All.jl), a Julia implementation of the [Earth4All model](https://earth4all.life/the-science-rp/). This implementation refers to the model described in [Dixson2022](https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/earth4all-book/) and in [Randers2022](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5111/), and to the Vensim implementation of the model available at [E4A2022](https://stockholmuniversity.app.box.com/s/uh7fjh52pvh7yx1mqfwqcyxdcvegrodf).
