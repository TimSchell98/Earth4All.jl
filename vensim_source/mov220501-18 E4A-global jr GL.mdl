		limited uptake). 
		This means 85 EUR/tCO2 declining to 63 when 1 USD = 0.9 EUR. Supports \
		Lavutslippsutvalget:
		To make gas power with CCS competitive with conventional gas power requires a carbon \
		price of 50 EUR/tCO2.
		Since each toe emits 2.8 tCO2, the cost of CCS is around 2.8*50 = 150 \
		EUR/toe.

This is the Earth4All-global jr model of a modern capitalist economy with endogenous distribution and an active state (the "Human World"). It is coupled to simple models of energy/climate and food/land (two important elements of the "Natural World"). The model is an early example of a (dynamic and causal)  global integrated assessment model, made to study the evolution of human wellbeing within planetary boundaries in the 21st century.
